This repository contains the files for Task 6 of the DevOps Internship. [cite_start]The goal was to deploy a simple, static HTML website using GitHub Pages[cite: 4].

## 🎯 Task Objective

[cite_start]To learn the process of deploying static content for free using GitHub's built-in Pages service[cite: 4, 15].

## 🚀 Deliverables

- **GitHub Repo:** `[https://github.com/Raffaann/devops-task-6]`
- **Live Website Link:** `[https://raffaann.github.io/devops-task-6]`

## 🛠️ Process Followed

1.  [cite_start]**Create Files:** Created a basic `index.html` file locally[cite: 9].
2.  [cite_start]**Add Styling:** Added a `style.css` file to customize the look of the page[cite: 14].
