# DevOps Internship - Task 6: Host a Static Website

This repository contains the files for Task 6 of the DevOps Internship. The goal was to deploy a simple, static HTML website using GitHub Pages[cite: 4].

## 🎯 Task Objective

To learn the process of deploying static content for free using GitHub's built-in Pages service.

## 🚀 Deliverables

.As required by the task, here are the links to the repository and the live website[cite: 6]:

- **GitHub Repo:** `[https://github.com/Raffaann/devops-task-6]`
- **Live Website Link:** `[https://raffaann.github.io/devops-task-6]`

## 🛠️ Process Followed

1.  **Create Files:** Created a basic `index.html` file locally.
2.  **Add Styling:** Added a `style.css` file to customize the look of the page.
3.  **Initialize Git:** Created a new local Git repository and committed the files.
4.  **Push to GitHub:** Pushed the local repository to this new GitHub repository.
5.  **Enable GitHub Pages:**
    * Navigated to the repository's **Settings > Pages** tab.
    * Set the **Source** to "Deploy from a branch".
    * Selected the **`main`** branch and the **`/(root)`** folder.
6.  **Deploy:** After saving, GitHub Actions automatically built and deployed the site.
7.  **Verify:** Accessed the live website using the link provided by GitHub on the Pages settings screen.

## 💡 Outcome

This task successfully demonstrates the simple and cost-effective workflow for hosting static websites. .By following the steps, I learned how to deploy static content directly from a GitHub repository, a key skill for sharing documentation, portfolios, or project landing pages[cite: 15].

## 🔧 Tools Used

* **Git & GitHub:** For version control and remote repository hosting.
* .**GitHub Pages:** The service used for deploying the static site[cite: 5].
* **VS Code:** Local code editor for creating the `index.html` and `style.css` files.
